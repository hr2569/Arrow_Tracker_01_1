<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's initial problem statement from a previous session involved fixing internationalization (i18n) bugs and a zoom jumping issue on the scoring screen.

During the current session, the user reported a cascade of new and recurring issues:
1.  **Recurring Jump Bug**: The arrow marker on the scoring screen jumps when placed near another arrow. This has been the most persistent and critical issue.
2.  **Recurring Rogue Modal**: A Finish Session? confirmation modal from the  screen was appearing on other screens and was being triggered incorrectly by the hardware back button.
3.  **Recurring i18n Issues**: Hardcoded English strings remained in the app, most notably within the generated PDF performance reports.
4.  **Incorrect Back Navigation**: After completing a session, using the back button would navigate the user through the previous steps of the session (scoring, setup) instead of returning to the home screen.
5.  **App Crash**: The app was crashing when trying to save a round, later identified as being caused by an incorrect import.
6.  **Magnifier Arrow Sizing**: The user provided conflicting feedback on the size of arrows in the zoom magnifier, first requesting them to be bigger, then stating they were too big.
7.  **Version Display & Updates**: The user requested multiple version updates (up to ) and pointed out that the version number was not updating correctly on the Home and Settings screens.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has implemented fixes for a wide range of issues reported by the user.
- **Navigation**: The incorrect back-button behavior was addressed by replacing  with  in the session creation flow, preventing completed steps from being added to the navigation history.
- **Rogue Modal**: The persistent modal issue was fixed by using the  hook to ensure the  is only active when the summary screen is visible. An app crash related to this fix (caused by an incorrect import) was also resolved.
- **i18n**: A major refactor was performed on  to translate all hardcoded strings within the PDF generation logic. New translation keys were added to  and .
- **Jump Bug**: A fourth attempt was made to fix this critical bug. The latest fix involves wrapping the arrow markers in a  that uses  to disable touches on existing arrows while a new one is being placed, aiming to prevent touch event conflicts.
- **UI & Versioning**: The arrow size in the magnifier was adjusted, and the app version was updated to  (build ) across , the Home screen, and the Settings screen.
- **EAS Build Issue**: An attempt to fix package dependency mismatches was reverted at the user's request, as the underlying Expo Go failure was a known, long-standing issue the user did not want to address.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent just finished a batch of critical fixes: the navigation back-button flow, the recurring rogue modal, the PDF i18n translations, and updating the version display on the Home/Settings screens.
- **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done**: N (Agent performed code compilation checks but could not functionally test native behavior like navigation, gesture handling, or PDF generation.)
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: Manual testing by the user via an EAS build is required to verify all recent fixes.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **(P1) Enable and Finalize Competition Menu**: This was the original feature request for the next version (). It involves enabling the button on the home screen and reviewing the competition workflow.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **(P2) Final Icon Consistency Review**: A full app review to ensure all icons are replaced with SVGs from the new system implemented in a previous session.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Fixed Back Navigation**: Changed  to  in the session flow (, ) to prevent navigating back into a completed session.
- **Fixed Rogue Modal & App Crash**: Resolved the recurring modal bug in  using  and fixed a subsequent app crash by correcting the library import for the hook.
- **Major i18n Refactor**: Translated all hardcoded strings in the PDF reports by refactoring  and updated  and  translation files.
- **Attempted Jump Bug Fix**: Implemented a new strategy in  using a  wrapper with  to prevent touch conflicts.
- **Adjusted Magnifier Arrow Size**: Set the arrow size in the zoom magnifier to  in .
- **Updated App Version**: Updated the version to  and  to  in  and ensured it displays correctly on the Home () and Settings () screens.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - **Expo Go Build Failure**: The agent identified package version mismatches as the cause of Expo Go failures, but the user requested to revert these fixes, stating it was a known, pre-existing issue they did not want to address at this time. This technical debt remains.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue recurrence in this fork**:
    - arrow jumping bug in . (Recurrence count: 4+)
    - Rogue modal in . (Recurrence count: 2+)
    - Hardcoded i18n strings. (Recurrence count: 2+)
  - **Status**: All are  after new fixes were applied.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
- **Gesture Handling**: A complex interaction between the React Native Responder system,  (), , and  is at the core of the main bug in .
- **Navigation**:  (),  (), and the  API are used for navigation logic and fixing history/modal bugs.
- **i18n**:  with JSON files for translations.
- **PDF Generation**: Dynamically creating an HTML string with inlined SVG and styles to be converted into a PDF.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- ** Touch Logic**: The gesture and touch handling logic is extremely fragile. If the current jump bug fix fails, the entire implementation should be refactored to use a single, consistent system () for all touch interactions on the target.
- **Package Dependencies**: The project has known package version mismatches that were intentionally not fixed per the user's request. This remains a source of technical debt and may cause issues with future EAS builds or tool compatibility.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- Your first priority is to await user verification for the latest batch of fixes. The three most critical and recurring bugs (jump issue, rogue modal, i18n) have all had new fixes applied.
- The user tests via EAS builds, not Expo Go. Do not attempt to fix Expo Go-related issues unless the user explicitly asks. The user has previously been firm about not wanting this fixed.
- Be prepared for the jump bug in  to persist. It is a complex interaction of multiple touch systems, and previous fixes have failed. If it fails again, you should propose a more fundamental refactor of that component's touch handling logic.
- The user is very hands-on and provides detailed feedback, including videos. Use this information carefully to diagnose issues.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None in this session.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages** 
- **LATEST**: User reports i18n and back navigation issues are still present. (IN PROGRESS, fixes applied)
- User provides details: i18n issue is recurrent and affects PDFs, specifies , and clarifies the desired back-button behavior after finishing a session. (IN PROGRESS, fixes applied)
- User requests app version and code version update. (COMPLETED)
- User reports the app is crashing when saving a round. (COMPLETED, fixed by correcting an import)
- User requests app version and code version update. (COMPLETED)
- User reports the back action triggers the Finish Session? menu incorrectly. (COMPLETED, fixed with )
- User reports the Finish Session? menu is showing everywhere. (COMPLETED)
- User requests app version and code version update. (COMPLETED)
- User confirms two arrows should be placeable next to each other, leading to a tweak in the jump-fix. (COMPLETED)
- User asks the agent to test the jump fix before they build, since it's the 4th attempt. (COMPLETED, agent explained the logic)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The app's core functionalities (scoring, navigation, i18n) have been plagued by recurring bugs. Although fixes have been applied for all reported issues, the app's stability is unconfirmed until the user completes testing.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: None
  - Known regressions: The jump bug, the rogue modal bug, and i18n issues are all known regressions that have been repeatedly addressed in this session. The latest fixes are pending verification.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- Nothing was forgotten. The agent addressed all user requests, but the effectiveness of the fixes for highly recurring bugs is still unverified.</analysis>
