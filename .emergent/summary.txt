<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's initial goal was to fix two bugs in their archery scoring application:
1.  Several menus and alerts remained in English after changing the language.
2.  The view jumps on the scoring screen when zoomed in and placing arrows close together.

During the session, the user added further requirements:
- After a fix was implemented, the user specified that volta should be changed to turno in the Portuguese translation.
- The user pointed out that the generate report screen was still untranslated.
- The user requested to update the application version to  and set the owner and Expo project ID in .

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent successfully fixed the initial internationalization (i18n) and zoom-jumping bugs. The core of the work involved a significant refactor to remove hardcoded strings across multiple files (, , , etc.) and replace them with the  hook.

Following user feedback, the agent then:
1.  Implemented comprehensive translations for the large  file, which was previously entirely hardcoded in English. This involved adding dozens of new translation keys to  and .
2.  Updated  to replace all instances of Volta with Turno as requested.
3.  Updated  to set the version to  () and configured the  and  fields.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent just finished updating the  file with the new  and  as per the user's final request.
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y (Verified via viewing the file)
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: N/A
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - **Issue 1**: Complete verification of the  screen internationalization (P0)
  
  **Issues Detail**:
  - **Issue 1**: 
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent refactored the entire  file to use the  framework and added all required translation keys. A testing agent run was initiated (), but the agent was interrupted by new user requests (versioning) and **never processed the test results**.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1.  Immediately call the  to perform a comprehensive test.
       2.  Instruct the testing agent to specifically navigate to the Report screen after setting the language to Portuguese.
       3.  Verify that all text elements (headers, buttons, filters, chart labels, statistics) are correctly translated.
       4.  Verify the Portuguese translation uses Turno instead of Volta.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the final step to close out the user's major i18n bug reports. The work is likely complete, but it is unverified.
     - **Status**: TESTING PENDING
     - **Is recurring issue?**: Y (The i18n issues have required multiple rounds of fixes).
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **(P1) Enable and Finalize Competition Menu**: This was the original feature request for version . It involves enabling the button on the home screen and reviewing the existing competition flow. This should only be started after all i18n bugs are fixed and verified by the user.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **(P2) Ensure Icon Consistency**: Review all screens and replace any remaining text or emoji-based icons with proper SVGs for a consistent UI.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Fixed Core i18n Bug**: Resolved issue where navigation headers did not translate by removing hardcoded  options in  and dynamically setting them within each screen (, ) using .
- **Verified Zoom Bug Fix**: Confirmed via testing agent that adding  to the pan gesture in  fixed the zoom jumping issue.
- **Translated **: Fully refactored the previously untranslated  file to support internationalization.
- **Updated Portuguese Locale**: Changed Volta to Turno in  per user request.
- **Updated App Version**: Incremented the version to  and  to  in .
- **Updated App Ownership**: Set the  and  in .
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused imports from  and .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Round summary menu and other navigation elements were not translated.
- **Recurrence count**: 2 (The issue persisted after the first fix attempt and required a deeper fix in ).
- **Status**: RESOLVED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: , . The key challenge was ensuring components re-render on language change, which was solved by moving title settings from the static  file into individual screen components using  and .
- **Gesture Handling**: .
- **Expo Configuration**:  for managing app metadata like version, owner, and project ID.

**key DB schema**
- N/A (Client-side focus)

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- **Files for i18n fix & verification**: , , .
- **Modified configuration**: .
- **Other modified files**: , , .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Your first action is to test**. The previous agent implemented a large number of i18n fixes in  but was interrupted before it could verify them. You MUST run the  to confirm that the report screen is fully translated to Portuguese and that Turno is used correctly.
- Do not assume the  fix is complete. The user has found issues with i18n before, so thorough verification is non-negotiable before finishing the task.
- Once testing is complete and successful, you can finish the job, summarizing the completed bug fixes and presenting the upcoming Competition Menu task to the user.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages** 
- ** (LATEST)**: Request to update . (COMPLETED)
- ****: Request to update the app version. (COMPLETED)
- ****: User approval to proceed after the agent initiated a test run. The agent misinterpreted this and moved to versioning instead of waiting for test results.
- ****: Critical user feedback identifying two new i18n issues. (COMPLETED, PENDING VERIFICATION)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The application's state is unknown. A major refactoring of the  screen was performed, but it has not been verified. The i18n feature cannot be considered stable until a full test pass is complete.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES. However, the agent failed to process the results of the *final* test run.
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
- **Test files created**: None.
- **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent failed to wait for and process the results of its final  call (initiated in Chat Message 155). The user's continue message and subsequent requests caused the agent to get distracted and move on without verifying its last, most significant code change (the  translation).</analysis>
