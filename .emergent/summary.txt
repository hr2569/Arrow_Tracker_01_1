<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's goal is to build an archery scoring application. The immediate task is to implement a zoom-on-touch feature for precise arrow placement, similar to a reference app called MyTargets.

The initial implementation involved zooming the entire target, but this was rejected by the user. The new, current requirement is to implement this feature as a magnifying glass style zoom:
- The main target face should remain zoomed out.
- When the user touches and drags on the target, a separate, zoomed-in box should appear (e.g., on the right side).
- This box should show a magnified view of the area under the user's finger and move as they drag.

The user has also requested the app version be updated to  and displayed on the home screen.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a React Native (Expo) app for scoring archery rounds.
- The app version has been updated to  in .
- A small, gray version number () is now displayed at the bottom of the home screen ().
- A zoom-on-touch feature that transforms the entire target was implemented in . A stale closure bug within this feature was fixed using . However, the user has rejected this entire implementation approach due to poor usability.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was working on displaying the app's version number on the home screen as requested by the user. This task was heavily delayed by a Metro bundler caching issue, where file changes were not being reflected in the web preview. The agent spent a significant amount of time debugging the layout with various CSS-in-JS approaches before realizing the bundler needed a restart. The task was successfully completed after restarting the

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: The current zoom-on-touch implementation is not what the user wants. (P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - **Description**: The user has rejected the current feature that zooms the entire target on touch. The user feedback is: zoom and drag still bugged. it zooms on top of the click and it makes it hard. The new requirement is to redesign the feature completely to be a magnifying glass style view. A separate, zoomed-in box should appear on the side of the screen, showing the area under the user's finger.
     - **Attempted fixes**: The previous agent implemented a full-target zoom using  and fixed a stale-closure bug within it. This entire approach is now considered incorrect based on user feedback.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Research the UI/UX of the MyTargets app for inspiration, as requested by the user.
        2.  Go to .
        3.  Remove or comment out the existing  logic that scales the entire target view.
        4.  Plan the new component structure. This will likely involve:
            - A new state variable to control the visibility of the magnifier box.
            - A new state variable to store the position and content of the magnifier.
            - A new component for the magnifier box itself.
        5.  Update the 's  handler to update the position for the magnifier view, but NOT transform the main target.
        6.  The magnifier component will likely need to render a clipped and scaled portion of the target image.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the core feature the user wants for version 1.1.0. Implementing it correctly will make arrow placement more precise and intuitive, fulfilling the user's primary request.
     - **Status**: NOT STARTED
     - **Is recurring issue?** Y (The concept of getting the zoom feature right is recurring)
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (Native gesture behavior)
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- (None)

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **P0**: Redesign and implement the magnifying glass zoom feature in  as per the new user requirements.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Bug Fix (Rejected Feature)**: Fixed a stale closure bug in the  logic in  by using  to track touch state.
- **Version Update**: Updated the application version to  in .
- **UI Update**: Added the version number as a small gray text at the bottom of the home screen in .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- (None)

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Shot visualizations are not centered correctly on the target face.
  - **Recurrence count**: 2
  - **Status**: RESOLVED (in a previous fork, no new recurrence noted)

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
- **Gesture Handling**: React Native  API will still be needed for the new implementation.
- **UI/Layout**: The new task will involve creating a new magnifier view, likely using absolute positioning and image clipping techniques.
- **Development Environment**: Metro Bundler caching can be aggressive. If code changes do not appear in the preview, restart the

**key DB schema**

- : The home screen file where the version number was added.
- : The app configuration file.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file contains the logic for the rejected feature. This should be removed and replaced with a cleaner implementation, potentially breaking out the new Magnifier into its own component to keep  manageable.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The previous zoom implementation is REJECTED**. Do not try to fix or build upon the logic that scales the entire target. The user has provided a new, completely different design.
- **New Requirement**: Implement a magnifying glass. When the user touches and drags on the target, a separate, zoomed-in box should appear on the side, showing the area under the user's finger.
- **CRITICAL DEBUGGING NOTE**: The Metro bundler may serve stale code. If your file edits do not appear to have any effect, the first step should be to restart the frontend service: frontend: ERROR (no such process)
frontend: ERROR (no such process). This was the cause of a major delay in the previous session.
- The task is native-focused, but ensure the web fallback (simple click) is not broken during implementation.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The previous agent did not identify the Metro bundler caching issue quickly, leading to a significant amount of wasted time trying to debug a layout problem that was actually a build/cache issue. The key learning is to restart the bundler if changes are not reflected.</analysis>
