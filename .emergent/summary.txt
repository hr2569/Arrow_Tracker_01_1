<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's goal is to build a full-featured archery scoring application. The current priority is to fix two critical user-reported bugs before starting new feature development ( - Competition menu).
1.  Several menus and alerts (e.g., Cancel, Discard, Save, Round Summary) remain in English even after changing the application's language.
2.  On the scoring screen, when zoomed in, the view jumps when placing an arrow marker near an existing one.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has performed a large-scale refactoring to address hardcoded English strings across the application. The  hook and  function have been added to , , , and . The translation files ( and ) have been updated with numerous new keys to support these changes.

A potential fix for the zoom jumping bug has also been implemented in  by adding a  property to the , which is intended to prevent conflicts between the pan/zoom gesture and the touch responder for placing arrows.

However, verification using screenshots revealed that translations are not being applied correctly on navigation (e.g., the Home and History screens remain in English after changing the language in Settings). The user has also explicitly stated that the round summary menu is still not translated, indicating the fixes in  are incomplete or incorrect.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent had just been informed by the user that the round summary menu is still not translated, despite the recent refactoring work. The agent acknowledged this and was about to begin investigating this specific failure. This interrupted the agent's plan to call the testing subagent.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N (Attempted via screenshots, but this method proved insufficient and misleading, as it did not catch the persistent translation issue on the summary page.)
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: testing_agent_v3_fork. The testing agent is required to perform a comprehensive end-to-end test. The test should include:
    1. Changing the language to Portuguese.
    2. Navigating to the **Summary** screen to verify the Round Summary and all other elements are translated (this is the top priority).
    3. Navigating to the **History** and **Home** screens to verify they re-render with the correct language.
    4. Testing the **Scoring** screen to confirm the zoom jumping issue is resolved.
- **User Testing Done**: Y (User confirmed the round summary is still not translated).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Round summary menu is not translated to Portuguese (P0)
  - Issue 2: Implemented i18n changes do not reflect on navigation (P1)
  - Issue 3: The implemented fix for the zoom jumping bug is unverified (P1)
  
  **Issues Detail**:
  - **Issue 1**: 
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent refactored  to use the  hook and added corresponding keys to  and . This was not successful.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1.  View  again to find any remaining hardcoded strings.
       2.  Verify that the correct translation keys are being used in the  function calls.
       3.  Check  to ensure the  keys have the correct Portuguese translations.
       4.  Investigate if a component re-rendering issue is preventing the new translation from being displayed.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a direct bug report from the user and is the highest priority. Fixing it will move the i18n task closer to completion.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

  - **Issue 2**: 
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent refactored  to pass the  function as a prop to child components. However, testing showed pages do not update their language after navigation.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1.  The primary suspect is that components do not re-render when the language changes via .
       2.  Focus on  and  to see how language changes can trigger a global state update or re-render.
       3.  Using  in combination with  might be necessary for each screen that doesn't update.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will make the internationalization feature functional across the entire application.
     - **Status**: NOT STARTED
     - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

  - **Issue 3**: 
     - **Attempted fixes**: An initial fix was implemented by adding  to the  in .
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1.  This needs to be tested thoroughly. Use the testing agent or manual testing to zoom in on the scoring target.
       2.  Place an arrow.
       3.  Try to place a second arrow very close to the first one and confirm the view does not jump or pan unexpectedly.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Fixes a significant UX bug in the application's core scoring feature.
     - **Status**: TESTING PENDING
     - **Is recurring issue?**: N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - **Task 1**: Complete and verify the internationalization refactoring (P0)
     - **Where to resume**: Start by debugging why the round summary page is not translated as reported by the user. Look at .
     - **What will be achieved with this?**: All user-facing text will be translatable, resolving the user's primary bug report.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on something**: No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **(P1) Enable and Finalize Competition Menu**: This was the original feature request for version . It involves enabling the button on the home screen and reviewing the existing competition flow. This should only be started after both P0 and P1 bugs are fixed and verified.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **(P2) Ensure Icon Consistency**: Review all screens and replace any remaining text or emoji-based icons with proper SVGs for a consistent UI.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Implemented i18n Refactoring**: Replaced hardcoded strings with  calls in , , , and .
- **Updated Translation Files**: Added numerous new keys to  and .
- **Refactored **: Modified child components (, ) to accept the  function as a prop to enable translation.
- **Implemented Zoom Bug Fix**: Added a  property to the pan gesture in  as a potential solution to the zoom jumping issue.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: , . The core of the current task. A key challenge is ensuring components re-render when the language is changed.
- **Gesture Handling**: . A  property was added to a  to resolve a gesture conflict.

**key DB schema**
- N/A (Client-side focus)

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- **Files for i18n fix**:  (NEEDS IMMEDIATE REVIEW), , , , , .
- **Files for zoom bug**: .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Address the user's feedback first**: The user has explicitly stated the round summary menu is still not translated. Your first action must be to investigate and fix this issue in .
- **Do not trust screenshot verification for i18n**: The previous agent's screenshot-based testing was insufficient. It showed translations on the settings page but failed to reveal that other pages did not update.
- **Use the testing agent**: After fixing the summary page, you MUST use the  to perform a comprehensive test of all bug fixes (i18n on all pages, and the zoom fix). Simple navigation and screenshots are not reliable here.
- The root cause of pages not updating their language is likely due to components not re-rendering after  is called. This is a common issue with  and .

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages** 
- **the round summary menu is still not translated (LATEST)**: This is the most critical and recent piece of feedback. The user has tested the agent's work and found it incomplete. This must be the top priority.
- **proceed**: User's initial approval to fix the bugs.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The primary i18n feature is incomplete and not functioning as expected on key screens, as confirmed by the user. The fix for the second major bug (zoom jumping) remains unverified.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None.

**Testing status**
- Testing agent used after significant changes: NO (The agent was about to, but was interrupted by the user's bug report).
- Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
- Test files created: None
- Known regressions: None

**Credentials to test flow:**
- N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not forget to execute a task, but its verification methodology was flawed. It relied on screenshots which did not accurately represent the application's state after navigation, leading it to miss the lingering i18n bugs that the user later found. It should have used a more robust testing method like the testing agent sooner.</analysis>
