<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's overall goal is to refine and fix an archery scoring application. The session focused on fixing the Android App Bundle (AAB) build process and then implementing a new feature: a zoom-on-touch for easier arrow placement on the target, similar to a reference application called MyTargets. The user also requested several version updates and a change of the app icon. The final user feedback indicates the new zoom feature is not working as expected and requires a double click.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a React Native (Expo) application for archery scoring. The Android deployment pipeline, which was previously blocked, has been fixed (package name, version, signing keys, etc.). A new feature for version 1.1.0, zoom-on-touch arrow placement, has been implemented for native platforms by transforming the target view on touch. The web version retains a simpler, functional click-to-place mechanism. However, the new native feature has a bug.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was implementing the zoom-on-touch feature in  for native platforms. After user feedback that an initial magnifier overlay approach wasn't working well, the agent researched how the MyTargets app works and re-implemented the feature to transform (zoom and translate) the entire target view during a touch-and-drag gesture.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N (The agent tested the web fallback but could not fully validate the native-specific gesture behavior, which led to the user discovering the bug.)
- Which testing method agent to use? Manual code debugging of the gesture handlers in  is required. The agent should add extensive logging to trace the PanResponder lifecycle.
- User Testing Done: Y (The user tested the feature and reported the click twice bug.)

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Zoom-on-touch feature requires a double click to place an arrow. (P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - **Description**: On native platforms, the new arrow placement feature requires the user to interact twice with the target to place an arrow. The expected behavior is a single, continuous touch-hold-drag-release gesture.
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent implemented a gesture handler using React Native's  in . The implementation correctly transforms the view on touch, but the logic for finalizing the action on touch release is flawed.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Thoroughly review the  implementation within .
        2.  Focus on the , , and  functions and their interaction with the , , and  states.
        3.  The bug is most likely in  or the  configuration. Analyze why the action (placing the arrow via ) doesn't complete correctly on the first gesture release.
        4.  Add  statements to trace the PanResponder lifecycle events (, , , ) to understand the event flow of a single touch.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will fix the core functionality of the new feature, making it intuitive and completing the user's request for version 1.1.0.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?** N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (Native behavior)
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- (None)

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- None. The current priority is to fix the zoom-on-touch feature to finalize version 1.1.0.

**Completed work in this session**
- **AAB Build & Publishing**:
  - Corrected the Android package name in  to , resolving a Google Play Store rejection error.
  - Updated the app version to  and  to  in .
  - Updated the  and  fields in  as per user request.
- **UI & Asset Updates**:
  - Replaced the application icon with a new user-provided image (, ).
  - Converted the black background of the new icon to be transparent.
- **Feature Development**:
  - Researched and implemented a zoom-on-touch feature for arrow placement, inspired by the MyTargets application. This involved refactoring an initial magnifier overlay approach to a more robust view transform approach using .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- (None)

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Shot visualizations are not centered correctly on the target face.
  - **Recurrence count**: 2
  - **Status**: RESOLVED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
- **Gesture Handling**: React Native  API
- **Animations/Transforms**:  for scaling and translating views
- **Platform-Specific Code**:  to separate native gesture logic from web click logic.

**key DB schema**
- N/A (Client-side storage via AsyncStorage)

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : **This is the main file to debug.** It contains all the logic for the scoring screen, including the buggy  implementation for the zoom-on-touch feature.
- : Was updated multiple times for version, package name, owner, and project ID.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file has become very complex. Once the current bug is fixed, it would be beneficial to break it down into smaller, more manageable components (e.g., a dedicated  component with its own gesture handling).

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The ONLY task is to fix the click twice bug** in the zoom-on-touch feature in .
- The user's feedback (almost perfect) implies the visual zoom effect is working correctly, but the action of placing the arrow on gesture release is failing on the first try.
- The feature is **native-only**. The web implementation uses a simple  and should remain unchanged. Do not waste time trying to make the gesture work on the web preview.
- The bug is almost certainly in the  configuration or the logic within its release handler ( or the  function it calls). Trace the state changes and event flow carefully.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- (None)

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-  (Status: **Pending Fix**)
-  (Status: Addressed by researching MyTargets and reimplementing the zoom feature)
-  (Status: Addressed; led to keeping web implementation simple)
-  (Status: IN PROGRESS)
-  (Status: Fixed)
-  (Status: Done)
-  + image (Status: Addressed; confirmed it was a non-blocking warning)
-  (Status: Done)
-  + image showing package name mismatch (Status: Fixed by reverting package name to original)
-  (Status: Done)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The primary new feature (zoom-on-touch) for version 1.1.0 is not working correctly.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None.

**Testing status**
- Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
- Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
- Test files created: None
- Known regressions: None, but the new feature is buggy.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not/could not fully test the native-specific gesture implementation before summarizing the work, which resulted in the user finding the double click bug. The agent should have relied on more robust debugging techniques like logging the entire gesture lifecycle to ensure correctness.</analysis>
