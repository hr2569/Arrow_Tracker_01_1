<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's goal is to build a full-featured archery scoring application.

The current major goal is to release version , which will include:
1.  A Language option in a new Settings menu, with support for English, Portuguese (European), Spanish, French, Italian, Finnish, Swedish, Russian, and Ukrainian.
2.  A new Competition menu.

The immediate focus is on completing the Language/Internationalization feature.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a React Native (Expo) app for scoring archery rounds. The agent is in the middle of implementing the internationalization (i18n) feature for version .
- A comprehensive set of translation keys has been created in .
- All other language files (, , , , , , , ) have been updated with the same key structure, but mostly contain English placeholder text for their values.
- The  hook has been implemented in the  and  screens, replacing hardcoded text with translation keys.
- Other screens (, , , etc.) still contain hardcoded English strings.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was systematically applying the  hook and  function to all application screens to replace hardcoded text. It had just completed the  and  files.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent. The task involves UI changes across the entire application, which requires comprehensive testing to ensure all text elements are translated correctly when the language is changed in the settings.
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Incomplete translation implementation in app screens (P0)
- Issue 2: Incomplete translations in language files (P1)
- Issue 3: Incorrect Portuguese dialect (P1)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1:
     - **Description**: Many screens still have hardcoded English text and do not use the i18n system. So far, only  and  have been updated.
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent has successfully integrated the  hook into  and .
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1. Continue the process for the remaining files: , , , and any other components with user-facing text.
       2. For each file, import  and replace hardcoded strings with .
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the main task required to complete the internationalization feature for the v2.0.0 release.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?**: N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

  - Issue 2:
     - **Description**: The translation files for Spanish, French, Italian, Finnish, Swedish, Russian, and Ukrainian contain the correct key structure but use English text as placeholder values.
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent created the file structures.
     - **Next debug checklist**: Systematically translate the English placeholder values in each of the following files: , , , , , , .
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To provide the complete set of promised languages for the v2.0.0 release.
     - **Status**: NOT STARTED
     - **Is recurring issue?**: N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

  - Issue 3:
      - **Description**: The user specified European Portuguese, but the generated  file may be incomplete or use the wrong dialect for some keys. It currently contains many English placeholders.
      - **Attempted fixes**: The agent created the  with the correct key structure and made an initial attempt to add some European Portuguese translations.
      - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Thoroughly review .
        2.  Translate all remaining English placeholder values to European Portuguese.
        3.  Verify the correctness of existing Portuguese translations.
      - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To meet the user's specific requirement for the Portuguese language.
      - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
      - **Is recurring issue?**: N
      - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
      - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Complete the internationalization of the entire application (P0)
     - **Where to resume**: The agent just finished updating . The next file to modify is .
     - **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully translatable application codebase.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on something**: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **Implement Competition Menu (P0)**: As part of the v2.0.0 release, create a new Competition menu. Requirements need to be gathered from the user for this feature.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - None specified.

**Completed work in this session**
- **i18n Scaffolding**:
  - Created a comprehensive set of translation keys in .
  - Standardized all 9 translation files to use the same key structure.
- **i18n Implementation**:
  - Applied translations (using  hook) to .
  - Applied translations to .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None for this session.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
- **Internationalization (i18n)**:  and  for managing translations.
- **State Management**: React state (, ).
- **Navigation**: .

**key DB schema**
- N/A (Client-side storage via AsyncStorage)

**changes in tech stack**
- None in this session.

**All files of reference**
- **Modified in this session**:
  - : All 9 translation files were rewritten with a new, comprehensive key structure.
  - : Updated to use .
  - : Updated to use .
- **Files Requiring Modification**:

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- Hardcoded strings in , , , and other components need to be replaced with the  function from .

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Top Priority**: Your immediate task is to finish implementing the  hook across all remaining screens. The key structure is complete, so you just need to apply it. The next files to work on are , , and .
- After updating the code, the next step is to populate the language files (, , , etc.) with correct translations, paying special attention to the user's request for European Portuguese.
- Once the i18n feature is fully implemented and tested, you must ask the user for requirements for the Competition menu.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-  (Status: **Completed**)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Healthy**: The agent is making steady, systematic progress on the large internationalization task. The foundation is well-laid, and the work just needs to be completed.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None.

**Testing status**
- Testing agent used after significant changes: NO

- Test files created: None
- Known regressions: None

**Credentials to test flow:**
- N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent is in the middle of a large, multi-step task. Nothing has been forgotten, but it is critical to continue the work systematically until all screens are translated and all language files are populated.</analysis>
