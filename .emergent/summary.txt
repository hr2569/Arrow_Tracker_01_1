<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's goal is to build a full-featured archery scoring application.

The current major goal is to release version , which will include:
1.  A Language option in a new Settings menu, with support for English, Portuguese (European), Spanish, French, Italian, Finnish, Swedish, Russian, and Ukrainian.
2.  A new Competition menu.

The immediate focus is on completing the Language/Internationalization feature.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a React Native (Expo) app for scoring archery rounds, currently at a partially-implemented version .
- **Scoring**: Features a sophisticated magnifying glass zoom feature for precise arrow placement, which has undergone multiple iterations of bug fixes and improvements. It now correctly stays within screen bounds, shows previously marked arrows, and allows placing arrows close together.
- **History & Reports**: A history screen shows past sessions with stats (Average Score, Ends Played, Arrows Shot) that dynamically filter by time period (Day, Week, etc.). Each session has a report button leading to a detailed view.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: The agent has started setting up i18n using . It has installed dependencies, created a new  screen with a language selector, and added translation files for 9 languages. However, the implementation is incomplete, as only the home screen uses the translation system.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was implementing the internationalization (i18n) feature for version 2.0.0. It had set up the basic structure but was stopped by the user who pointed out that the translation was incomplete and the Portuguese dialect was incorrect.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent. This is a large feature that affects the entire UI. The agent should verify that all text across all screens is correctly translated when the language is changed.
- User Testing Done: Y (User confirmed the i18n implementation was incomplete)

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Incomplete translation implementation (P0)
- Issue 2: Incorrect Portuguese dialect (P1)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1:
     - **Description**: The i18n system was set up, but only the home screen () was updated to use it. All other screens and components still have hardcoded English text.
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent created the  config, translation files, and a  screen. It updated  to initialize . However, it failed to apply the  hook and  function to all relevant components.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1.  Systematically go through every  file under .
       2.  For each file, import the  hook from .
       3.  Replace all user-facing hardcoded strings (e.g., History, Average Score, Save, Delete) with the translation function .
       4.  Add the corresponding keys and translations to all JSON files in .
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To fulfill the primary requirement for version 2.0.0, allowing users to use the app in 9 different languages.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?**: N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

  - Issue 2:
     - **Description**: The user specified that the Portuguese translation should be European Portuguese, not the default which might be Brazilian.
     - **Attempted fixes**: None. This was new feedback from the user.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1.  Review and update the  file.
       2.  Ensure all translations conform to European Portuguese vocabulary and grammar. A web search for translations might be necessary.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To meet the user's specific language requirement and provide a better experience for European Portuguese speakers.
     - **Status**: NOT STARTED
     - **Is recurring issue?**: N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- Task 1: Complete the internationalization of the entire application (P0)
   - **Description**: This is the same as Pending Issue 1. The task is to fully integrate  across all screens.
   - **Where to resume**: Start by modifying  to use the  function, then proceed to , , and any other components with UI text.
   - **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully translatable application.
   - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
   - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
   - **Blocked on something**: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
  - **Implement Competition Menu (P0)**: As part of the v2.0.0 release, create a new Competition menu. The user has not provided detailed requirements for this yet.
- **Future Tasks**:
  - None specified.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Magnifier Feature Overhaul ()**:
  - Fixed magnifier clipping at screen edges by dynamically adjusting its position.
  - Centered the magnifier on the user's touch point.
  - Corrected the internal alignment of the magnified view and the crosshair.
  - Updated the magnifier to render previously marked arrows within the zoomed view.
  - Resolved a cursor jump bug by changing arrow markers from  to  and managing , allowing arrows to be placed adjacently.
- **History Screen Enhancements ()**:
  - Added Arrows Shot to the statistics.
  - Made all statistics dynamically update based on the selected time filter.
  - Improved the visibility of the Report button per the user's request.
- **Versioning**:
  - Successfully updated the app version through , , and  in both  and the home screen UI.
  - Incremented  in  to resolve a Google Play Store upload conflict.
- **i18n Scaffolding (v2.0.0)**:
  - Installed  and .
  - Created a new  screen () with a language selector.
  - Created translation files for 9 languages under .
  - Moved the Backup functionality from the home screen to the new Settings screen.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue**: Shot visualizations are not centered correctly on the target face.
- **Recurrence count**: 2+
- **Status**: RESOLVED (The agent spent significant effort in this session fixing the magnifier's internal alignment and crosshair position, which directly relates to this issue).

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
- **Internationalization (i18n)**:  and  for managing translations.
- **Gesture Handling**:  for the scoring screen's touch-and-drag interactions.
- **State Management**: React state (, ) for managing UI, gestures, and scoring data.
- **Navigation**: .

**key DB schema**
- N/A (Client-side storage via AsyncStorage)

**changes in tech stack**
- Added  and  for internationalization.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The entire application needs to be refactored to remove hardcoded strings and use the  function from . This is the main pending task.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Top Priority**: Your immediate task is to finish the incomplete internationalization feature. This involves two parts:
  1.  Go through every screen (, , , etc.) and replace all hardcoded text with keys for the  translation function.
  2.  Update the Portuguese translation file () to use European Portuguese.
- After completing and verifying the i18n feature, the next major task is to begin work on the Competition menu. You will need to ask the user for requirements for this feature.
- The user tests the application using the Expo Go app on their device. Always provide the tunnel link when you've made changes.
