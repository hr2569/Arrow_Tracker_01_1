<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's initial problem statement from a previous session involved fixing internationalization (i18n) bugs and a zoom jumping issue on the scoring screen.

During the current session, the user reported several new and recurring issues:
1.  An EAS build was failing due to a  mismatch in .
2.  The app version was not displaying correctly on the home and settings screens.
3.  The arrow marker still jumps when it touches another arrow on the scoring screen (a recurring bug).
4.  A modal from the summary screen was incorrectly appearing on the history screen.
5.  The arrows in the magnifier (zoom) window were not scaled correctly.
6.  The user requested to update the app version to  and increment the .
7.  After analyzing a video provided by the user, a jump issue was identified on the scoring screen.
8.  The user requested to make the arrows in the zoom-in magnifier 50% bigger.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent addressed a series of bugs and requests. It first verified the i18n fixes from the previous session were working correctly. It then implemented a major UI improvement by replacing dozens of text/emoji-based icons with a consistent SVG icon system in .

Subsequently, the agent tackled several user-reported bugs:
- Fixed the version display across the app to show .
- Attempted to fix the recurring arrow jumping bug in  by adjusting gesture handler properties (, ).
- Fixed a rogue modal issue in  by adding a navigation  listener to ensure the modal closes when leaving the screen.
- Adjusted arrow scaling in the magnifier component in .
- Updated  to version  and .

The agent is currently analyzing a video from the user that demonstrates the persistent jump issue.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The user uploaded a video demonstrating a persistent jump on the scoring screen and requested two fixes: 1) Correct the jump, and 2) Make the arrows in the magnifier 50% bigger. The agent has just begun to process this request.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: Manual testing by the user on a device will be essential, as the issue relates to native gesture handling. The agent can take a screenshot to verify the visual change to the magnifier arrows.
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - **Issue 1**: The scoring screen jumps when placing or interacting with arrows, as shown in the user's video. (P0)
  
  **Issues Detail**:
  - **Issue 1**: 
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent previously increased  on the  to  and added  to the 's responder props in . These fixes were insufficient.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1.  Thoroughly analyze the user's video () to pinpoint the exact action that triggers the jump.
       2.  Re-investigate . The conflict is likely between the React Native Responder system and the .
       3.  Consider replacing the complex dual-system with a solution based solely on  (e.g., using  and  together).
       4.  Investigate if the  of the arrow markers is intercepting touch events intended for the target background. Experiment with the  prop.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a critical usability bug in the app's core scoring feature. Fixing it will make the app reliable for its main purpose.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - **Task 1**: Make the arrows in the zoom-in magnifier 50% bigger. (P0)

 **Task Detail**:
  - **Task 1**: 
     - **Where to resume**: In , locate the  component. The agent previously scaled the arrows *down* proportionally to the zoom level. This logic needs to be changed to scale the arrows to be 50% *larger* than their base size within the magnifier view.
     - **What will be achieved with this?**: Improves visibility of arrows in the zoom window, fulfilling a direct user request.
     - **Status**: NOT STARTED
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on something**: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **(P1) Enable and Finalize Competition Menu**: This was the original feature request for the next version (). It involves enabling the button on the home screen and reviewing the competition workflow.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **(P2) EAS Build Failure User Action**: The agent identified that an EAS build failure was due to the updated  not being synced. The user needs to be reminded to use the Save to GitHub feature.
    - **(P2) Final Icon Consistency Review**: A full app review to ensure all icons are replaced with SVGs from the new system.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Finalized i18n Fixes**: Verified the  screen translations were complete and correct using the testing agent.
- **SVG Icon System**: Replaced dozens of emoji/unicode icons with a consistent SVG icon system by refactoring  and updating .
- **Fixed Version Display**: Corrected the app version display to  in  and .
- **Fixed Rogue Modal**: Resolved an issue where a modal from  appeared on other screens by adding a  listener to close it upon navigation.
- **Updated App Version**: Updated  to  and .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue recurrence in this fork**: The arrow jumping bug on the scoring screen has recurred.
  - **Recurrence count**: 2+
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
- **Gesture Handling**:  () and the built-in React Native Responder system. The conflict between these two is the likely source of the current primary bug.
- **SVG Icons**: Implementation of a custom, scalable icon system using SVG path data within a React component.
- **Navigation Lifecycle**: Using navigation events () to manage component state.

**key DB schema**
- N/A (Client-side focus)

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : The location of the jump bug and the magnifier arrow sizing task.
- : Location of the resolved modal fix.
- : The new SVG icon component.
- : App configuration file.
- **User Video**: 

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The touch handling logic in  is fragile due to its reliance on two conflicting systems (Responder and Gesture Handler). It should be refactored to use only  for all touch interactions on the target to ensure predictable behavior.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- Your highest priority is to fix the jump issue detailed in the user's video. Your previous attempts were not successful, so a deeper investigation into the gesture/responder conflict in  is required.
- You must also implement the user's second request: make the arrows in the magnifier 50% bigger. This is also located in .
- The user will need to test the jump fix on a physical device, as it is a native gesture issue.
- Remember to remind the user that they must use the Save to GitHub feature to sync the  changes before their next EAS build will succeed.
